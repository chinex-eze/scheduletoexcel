					There are TWO basic ways to use this application:  <br /> <br />
					1. Copy your work schedule as it is and save it to a 
					   text file. 
					   <br />Then click on browse and upload 
					   the text document that you have saved. 
					   <br />Next, click on the submit button.
					   <br />The system returns a download link with a message. 
					   Click on the link and the excel file would be downloaded. <br /><br />
					2. The other method is quite easier. All you have to do is 
					   just copy the work schedule as it is, then paste it in the 
					   text area and click submit. Then a link to the file is returned. 
					   Click on the download link and you're ready to go! 
				</p>
				<p> 
					You can also create a HTML file and display it instead of excel. 
					<br />Just choose the HTML radio button.
					<br />
					<em>Note: <br />It is very important that you DO NOT alter the schedule the way it was sent to you.
							Just upload it or paste it exactly the way it is, click send and you are good to go!
					</em>
					<br />Enjoy :)
