				<p> 
					This site was initially created as a personal pet project to aid 
					the author with easy and fast web sheet creation...<br /> 
					Yeah, I know it doesn't look great but hey, it works great. 
					Hopefully in the future I'd get a chance to make it look better 
					and may be add some more functionality. For now, I think it 
					pretty much serves its main purpose.

					My name is Eze. That's right! It's me...hehe.
					I am currently studying at the Turku University of Applied Sciences. 
					I find the web to be a very interesting area of exploration.
