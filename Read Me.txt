This is a mini web application I developed some time ago to help my friends and I 
to convert our work schedule from plain text format to a more readable, well-arranged 
excel spread sheet.

Workers receieved their work schedules in text format via email. The schedule is copied 
and pasted on the web site or saved as a text .txt file and uploaded to the site. 
The application then converts this to an excel spread sheet with formulas for calculating 
total hours. The excel file is then sent back to user.
